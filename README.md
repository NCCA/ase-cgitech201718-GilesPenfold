# Genetic Flocking - Giles Penfold, MSc CAVE ASE & CGI Tech Assignment 2017/18

#### This is an genetic algorithm embedded into a flocking simulation. The flocking itself has been derived from NCCA Embedded Python code, the processing.org flocking example and the YABI flocking example.

## Requirements:

This works best using virtualenv (https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) to setup a stable python environment to run in.

- NCCA PyNGL (https://github.com/NCCA/NGL)
- PyQT5 (https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/download5)
- numpy (https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-dev/user/quickstart.html)
- OpenGL (https://www.opengl.org/sdk/)


## Running the system:

Make sure your Python environment is setup properly with the required packages.
Run NGLWindow.py.

## Using the system:

The GUI can be navigated using the mouse. The simulation cannot be interacted with once the start button has been clicked.
There are three tabs to flick between: Boids (to change boid parameters), Predators (to change predator parameters) and Genetics (to change genetic breeding parameters of the boids).

### Boids

Number of Boids: Adjust how many boids will appear in the simulation.

Cohesion Weight: Adjust the weighting by which the boids will cohese together in the flock.

Separation Weight: Adjust the weighting by which the boids will separate from each other within the flock.

Alighment Weight: Adjust the weighting by which the boids will align with each other in the flock.


### Predators

Number of Predators: Adjust how many predators will appear in the simulation.

Attack Weight: Adjust how aggressively the predators will try to seek out boids and move towards them

Sight Radius: Adjust how far the predators can see and which boids they will react to

Slowness: Adjust how slow the predators are, the higher the number the slower they become


### Genetics

Maximum Initial Awareness: Adjust the maximum possible range at which the boids will begin to notice predators close to them.

Maximum Initial Strength: Adjust the maximum possible level of strength the boids will have. The higher strength a boid has, the longer it can attempt to outrun a predator.

Maximum Initial Tiredness Rate: Adjust the maximum rate at which a boid tires whilst running away from a predator. The higher this number, the faster a boid will tire.

Maximum Initial Recovery Rate: Adjust the maximum rate at which a boid will recover energy after having become exhausted. The higher this number, the faster a boid will be able to recover energy.


### In-Depth Changes

There are a number of further global variables that can be changed within the boid2.py class that are not found within the GUI. There are commented within the code to explain what they do. The default values work well for the simulation, so adjust with care.
